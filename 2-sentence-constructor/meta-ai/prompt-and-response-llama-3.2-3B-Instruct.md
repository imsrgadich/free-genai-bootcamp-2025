        - BAD: no vocabulary table
        - BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should jsut start showing the vocabulary table
        - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
        - BAD: gives away the answer, doesn't provide opportunity for the student to think and attempt for an answer.

        That's a beautiful sentence. Here's the translation in Hindi:

        पुराने ओक के पेड़ ने पहाड़ियों के पीछे सूरज ढलने के दौरान हवा को रहस्यों की बातें बताईं।

        Please note that Hindi is a highly inflected language, and the word order may vary depending on the context and the desired emphasis. This translation is one possible way to convey the meaning of the original sentence.

        Here's a breakdown of the translation:

        पुराने ओक के पेड़ (purane oak ke ped) - The old oak tree
        ने (ne) - whispered ( implied by the verb बताईं, which means "told" or "whispered")
        पहाड़ियों के पीछे (pahadiyon ke peeche) - behind the hills
        सूरज ढलने के दौरान (sooraj dhalne ke dauraan) - as the sun set
        हवा को (hawa ko) - to the wind
        रहस्यों की बातें (rahasyon ki baaten) - secrets
        बताईं (batain) - whispered/told

        I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to practice more translations.

        Considerations:
            Think about the sentence structure in Hindi. Typically, Hindi sentences follow a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order. With this in mind, let's start building the sentence.

        Question:
            Can you try to identify the subject of the sentence? What word in the vocabulary table corresponds to the subject of the sentence ("the old oak tree")? Which word do you think best translates to "the old oak tree"?

        Possible next steps:
            - attempt an answer
            - ask clues about location marking
            - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
            - ask clues about question formation
            - ask clues about verb conjugation
